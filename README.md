# Supported Browsers
Well supported browsers include Chromium, Firefox, Falkon, Opera, Brave.

# Recommended Browser
Due to the usage of BigInt in JavaScript we recommend updated Chromium/Chrome based browsers. Brave and Opera should run fine.

On Firefox however, memory issues can be a problem. If you use Firefox, don't give the program a higher number (like > 5000) depending on your system.

# Unsupported Browsers
In the end of 2019, some of the browsers doesn't support BigInt (or BigNum), which allows to work with very big numbers.
Some of the browsers include Safari, Internet Explorer, EDGE, Midori, LuaKit that are known to show an Unsupported box.

Here's a Preview In Midori Browser:
